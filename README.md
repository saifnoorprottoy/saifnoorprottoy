- ðŸ”¨ I am building here : https://gitlab.com/elixir-networks
  
- ðŸ‘‹ Currently I am working as an independent security researcher (vulnerability research and bug bounty hunter) for my livelihood and to support my startup(s) [stealth mode]. 
 

- ðŸ‘€ Academically I am inclined towards language-based security and designing language technologies that can be used for safety & security analysis, which also might deal with things like memory safety. 
  
- âœ¨ I am an early adapter of Rust (2015). Besides I am using Python and Clojure for my mundane tasks. Did I mention Weird Machines??

-  ðŸ‘‰ I pretty much obsessed with Startups. Having said all of that, I am a huge fan of electronic music and might also become an electronic musician one day or a race car driver

- ðŸŒ± Thank you for your kind visit! :D Have a nice day!
