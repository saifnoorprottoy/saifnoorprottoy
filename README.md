- ðŸ‘‹ I am an independent security researcher currently trying to navigate the security startup realms by building tools and solutions by engaging various methodologies. Besides I am also working as a vulnerability researcher (Hypervisor and Container Focused, mostly ) and bounty hunter for my livelihood and to support my startups at the same time.
 

- ðŸ‘€ Academically I am inclined towards language based security and designing programming language technologies that can be used for security analysis and deals with things like memory safety. 
  
- âœ¨ I am an early adapter of Rust (2015). Besides I am using Python and Clojure for my mundane tasks. Did I mention Weird Machines??

-  ðŸ‘‰ I pretty much obsessed with Startups. Having said all of that, I am a huge fan of electronic music and might also become an electronic musician one day.  

- ðŸŒ± Thank you for your kind visit! :D Have a nice day!
