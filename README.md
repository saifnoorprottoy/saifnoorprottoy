- ðŸ‘‹ I mainly explore/develop various program analysis techniques and large-scale system analysis tools that may serve various purposes depending on the context. 
 

- ðŸ‘€ I am an early adopter of the Rust Programming Language (circa 2015) and very recently I have started to use the Clojure Language at the same time I am familiar with the C and Python Programming Languages. Besides, I like to read source code, a lot probably because of the nature of the work I do. My current/future endeavors include the inner world of systems like CDN(s), WebAPIs, OS/Hypervisors, eBPF, Netfilter, Compiler(s) & Interpreter(s), Language Libraries, Firmware(s) and io_uring.  
  
- âœ¨ I am very much obssesed with Startups. Having said that, I am a huge fan of electronic music and might also become an electronic musician one day.    

- ðŸŒ± Thank you for your kind visit! :D Have a nice day!
