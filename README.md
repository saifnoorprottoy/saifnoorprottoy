🎯 I'm an independent security researcher (vulnerability research, bug bounty hunting) supporting my stealth-mode startup(s). My academic interests focus on language-based security, designing safety & security analysis tools, and memory safety. I'm an early Rust adopter (2015) and use Python and Clojure for routine tasks. Fascinated by Weird Machines! Find me on X/GitHub/Medium/GitLab @saifnoorprottoy. 

✅️ Obsessed with startups, I’m also a fan of electronic music and aspire to be an electronic musician or race car driver. Thanks for visiting! :D Have a great day! ⚔
