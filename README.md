- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @saifnoorprottoy I mainly explore/develop various program analysis techniques and large-scale system analysis tools that may or may not be based on Formal Methods to find !!!???!!! in the system. Having said that, I am a huge fan of electronic music and might also become an electronic musician one day. 

- ðŸ‘€ I am an early adopter of the Rust Programming Language (circa 2015) and very recently (in 2022) I have started to use the Clojure Language too! Besides, I like to read source code, a lot probably. My current/future endeavors include the inner world of systems like CDN(s), GraphQL, Hypervisors/Unikernel, eBPF, Netfilter, Compiler(s) & Interpreter(s), various libraries, and io_uring. 
- ðŸŒ± Thank you for your kind visit! :D Have a nice day!
